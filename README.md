# AI Assistant with Weather and Task Management

An AI-powered voice assistant that can manage tasks and provide real-time weather updates. Built using Python, OpenAI's GPT-3 for intelligent responses, OpenWeatherMap API for weather data, and Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) for voice feedback. 

## Features

- **Voice Interaction**: Interact with the assistant using voice commands.
- **Task Management**: Add, view, and remove tasks stored in an SQLite database.
- **Weather Updates**: Get live weather information based on a specified city.
- **Voice Responses**: The assistant speaks back to you using gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech).

## Built With

- **Python**: The core programming language used.
- **OpenAI API**: For generating responses and conversations based on the user's input.
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: To fetch real-time weather information.
- **gTTS**: Google Text-to-Speech to convert text responses into speech.
- **SpeechRecognition**: For speech-to-text functionality.
- **SQLite**: To store tasks locally in a database.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have **Python 3.x** installed on your system. Then, clone the repository and install dependencies:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vaibhav-araikar/AI-Assistant-with-Weather-and-Task-Management.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd AI-Assistant-with-Weather-and-Task-Management
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Setup API Keys

Before running the project, you need to set up your API keys for OpenAI and OpenWeatherMap.

1. **OpenAI API Key**: Sign up at [OpenAI](https://beta.openai.com/signup/) and get your API key.
2. **OpenWeatherMap API Key**: Sign up at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) to get your API key.

### Update your code with the API keys:

In the `assistant.py` file, replace the placeholders for the API keys:

```python
openai.api_key = 'your-openai-api-key'
weather_api_key = 'your-openweathermap-api-key'
```

## Usage

1. Run the assistant by executing the Python script:
   ```bash
   python assistant.py
   ```
2. The assistant will ask for voice input, which you can give by speaking into the microphone. Based on your commands, it will perform tasks, provide weather updates, or answer questions.

### Commands
- "Weather": Provides the current weather update.
- "Tell me a joke": Responds with a joke.
- "Time": Tells you the current time.
- "Add task": Adds a new task to the to-do list.
- "View tasks": Displays all tasks saved in the system.
- "Remove task": Removes a task by its ID.
- "Exit" or "Stop": Exits the assistant.

## Challenges We Ran Into

- **Speech Recognition Accuracy**: Ensuring accurate voice command recognition for diverse accents.
- **Handling External APIs**: Managing API errors or unexpected responses from OpenAI and OpenWeatherMap services.
- **Voice Feedback in Colab**: Enabling voice output in a cloud environment like Google Colab required workarounds.

## What’s Next?

- Enhance natural language processing to handle more complex queries.
- Implement additional weather features like forecasts and alerts.
- Expand task management features like due dates or priority levels.
